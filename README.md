# 🚛 Smart Waste Truck Location Tracking System

## Overview
The Smart Waste Truck Location Tracking System is an IoT-based solution for tracking the real-time location of waste trucks. It utilizes a Node 6M GPS Module to obtain latitude and longitude data, which is then sent to the Firebase Realtime Database via an ESP8266 Node MCU Module. The Android App, developed in Kotlin, interfaces with Firebase services for authentication, cloud messaging, and storage to provide a comprehensive waste management solution.

## Features
- 🗺️ Real-time tracking of waste trucks on a map.
- 🔒 Firebase Authentication for waste clients and managers.
- 📬 Firebase Cloud Messaging for instant notifications on new waste pickup requests.
- 📊 Firebase Cloud Firestore for efficient storage of device tokens.
- 🚀 Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving latitude and longitude data.
- 📱 Android App with a user-friendly interface for clients and managers.
